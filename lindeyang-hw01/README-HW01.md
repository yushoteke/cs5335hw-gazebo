Hi, my name is Linde Yang. I also go by David.

I'm registered for the CS5335 grad course.

Here's my strategy:
I divided everything into 3 stages:
	1.turn right and avoid the red obstacles
	2.go straight
	3.turn left and reach the target

The robot decides which action to take using the pose sensor.
When the robot's x coordinates go above a threshold, it switches
to the next stage.
